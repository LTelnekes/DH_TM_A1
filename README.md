### Context
Considering my background in (North) American Studies, I have always been interested in American presidents, especially their rhetoric. Last year, I wrote my MA Thesis on American identity in the post-domestic-terror crisis rhetoric of President Trump. During a thesis meeting, my supervisor and I discussed how this influences public perception; however, as that was not the scope of my project, no official research on this was conducted. This inspired me for this project, but I decided to pick a different lens; namely, natural disasters which I believe are very relevant in this time and age. Different presidents in the 21st century have had to face different national disasters on American ground such as hurricanes, tornados, and wildfires. These have been significant to the U.S. and have posed complex challenges for presidents.

Focusing on times of crises in particular, presidents communicate in a form of epideictic speech which is known as the ‘national eulogy’. In this form of speech, presidents take on this role that associate professor of communication studies, [Vanessa Beasley](https://web-s-ebscohost-com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=e5d5d0e1-8981-4ae6-8c96-aac452c3c1b9%40redis&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl) (2011), called the ‘symbolic guardians of national unity.’ Communication scholars, [Karlyn Kohrs Campbell and Kathleen Hall Jamieson](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo5759249.html) (2008) explain this role as priestly, which a president takes on “to make sense of a catastrophe and transform it from evidence of destruction into a symbol of national resilience” (p. 73). At this moment, it is their role to unite the country, creating this sense of community which is part of epideictic speech. Fitting with the earlier named pair of definition and understanding, the national eulogy tries to give meaning to upsetting affairs and, at this moment, the president takes on a defining role. How does this form of speech then influence the public opinion of U.S. presidents? Political Scientist [John E. Mueller](https://www-jstor-org.proxy-ub.rug.nl/stable/pdf/1955610.pdf?refreqid=fastly-default%3Aa38918e1d8530f7edf27eab3014b58a6&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1) (1970) has tested a '""rally round the flag" variable which anticipates that international crises and similar phenomena will give a President a short-term boost in popularity" and concluded that "the variable proves to be a sturdy one and suggests a popular decline of about five or six percentage points for every year since the last "rally point'" (p. 20, 34).

I want to research how U.S. Presidents strategically communicated during natural disasters in the 21st century, to find out what impact this communication had on public approval rating, and to test if the claims made in 1970 by Mueller are still relevant.

### Research question
How did U.S. Presidents strategically communicate during natural disasters in the 21st century and what impact did this communication have on public approval ratings? Is Mueller's claim that the "rally round the flag" phenomenon and the presidential epideictic speech that is connected to this still relevant in the current political crisis climate?

Considering Bush's increased approval rating following 9/11 and the importance of natural disaster management, I think there is a big chance that Mueller's claim is still relevant and that public approval rates are positively influenced by natural disaster response by Presidents.

### Exploring the topic 
By analyzing earlier research into the topic, I can follow earlier examples laid out and test the claims made by these . By doing a good review of the literature, I will also be able to join an existing conversation and add to this by focusing on specific modern examples. I can address the research questions by combining the method of distant reading to analyze approval rating numbers, but also close reading to analyze the rhetoric of Presidents in speeches following natural disasters.

### Kinds of data needed
I would need the transcripts of the speeches following natural disasters in the 21st century and the data on the public approval ratings of presidents.

### Tools
I could use Python to find keywords or make statistical analyses about approval ratings. Maybe I could use programs to assist me with the reading of my transcripts.
